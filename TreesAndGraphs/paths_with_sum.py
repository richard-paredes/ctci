'''
You are given a binary tree in which each node contains an integer 
value which might be positive or negative. Design an algorithm
to count the number of paths that sum to a given value.
The path does not need to start or end at the root or a leaf, but
it must go downwards (traveling only from parent nodes to child nodes)
